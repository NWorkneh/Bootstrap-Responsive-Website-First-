            <p class="card-text"> Released: 2013 <br> <br> <br> By the time Tyler made Wolf, he had traveled the world, and his perspective on life and music was starting to shift. Sitting down for an interview with Spin while he was working on the project, he revealed, “Talking about rape and cutting bodies up, it just doesn’t interest me anymore. What interests me is making weird hippie music for people to get high to.” While he did begin to move away from some of the shock-and-awe that dominated his first two projects, though, Wolf still represented a relatively smooth next step forward from Goblin. He carried on some of the same storylines and characters from the first two records (his therapist Dr. TC even makes another appearance) but he did it with greater technical precision. It’s a well-crafted concept album that represents the best of Tyler’s early years, complete with standouts like “IFHY” and “Tamale,” which hold up to this day. If you look at his first three solo projects as a trilogy of sorts, Wolf was a fitting finale, a send-off to the characters and artistic sensibilities that defined the opening chapters of Tyler’s career, right before he was about to make a turn for something new. —Eric Skelton</p>

            <p class="card-text">Released: 2015 <br> <br> It’s too easy to dismiss Cherry Bomb as a transitory record, the weird cousin of Wolf and Flower Boy, or a sharp turn from the classic Tyler sound to the road he was about to enter on his next three albums. But it’s so much more than that. In a way, Cherry Bomb was Tyler’s Noah’s Arc moment. While it wasn’t his task to save humanity one species at a time like the biblical figure, he still treated his third LP like everything was on the line. He took any preconceived notions of his production skills and instead rebuilt his ship piece by piece, with chords that were beginning to sound brighter, wackier, and fuller, just to fit everything he wanted inside before he set sail. And what was it that he wanted inside Cherry Bomb that he couldn’t have possibly invited into his albums before? Well, few in 2015 had the suave-ness or appreciation for old-school pop to welcome Boyz II Men’s Wanya Morris on a hook (“Blow My Load,” for that matter), the courage to introduce a relatively fresh-faced Por Vida-era Kali Uchis to their growing fandom via “Find Your Wings,” the pull to link with heroes like Skateboard P a second time, or the pure power to get both Eezy’s (Wayne and Kanye, that is) on a track together—later inviting at least one of them to each of his following albums. At that point, Cherry Bomb was Tyler’s chance to get weird, sing a little more, and hint at the fact that his creative innovation was near the point of explosion, with no sign of a detonator in sight. —Brenton Blanchet</p>
