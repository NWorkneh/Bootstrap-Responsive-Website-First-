            <p>Released: 2017 <br> <br> <br> You can probably sense a pattern at this point: We feel like Tyler’s albums have generally improved as his career has progressed. 2017’s Flower Boy is when it all came together for Tyler. He had shown glimpses of greatness in his previous work, and his production has always been on-point, but Flower Boy was the project that represented the perfect nexus of soundscape, ambitious ideas, and sound execution. It’s a warm, introspective project where he bares more of himself than we’d previously heard on tracks like “When This Flower Blooms,” “November,” and yes, “I Ain’t Got Time” the track where some say he “came out.” But beyond that reveal, Tyler displayed a level of thoughtfulness and maturity that allowed him to ascend from an artist with potential to a full-blown star. His forays into love and romance went from occasionally disturbing on previous projects to relatable on the lovelorn “See You Again” with Kali Uchis. Flower Boy is a strong, rightfully Grammy-nominated album that straddled the line between rap and so-called pop, providing mass appeal with ingenuity and demonstrating that he had officially arrived at a new stage of his career. —Andre Gee</p>
