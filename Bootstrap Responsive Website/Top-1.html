<div class="row overview col-md-12 text-center">
  <p>Released: 2021 <br> A few days after releasing Call Me If You Get Lost, Tyler hopped on Instagram Live and played the beat from “Massa” for his followers. Replaying the opening drum break over and over, he put his hands to his face, stared straight into his phone, and yelled, “I’m so fucking good, dude, it’s so crazy!” He wasn’t lying. Tyler’s technical skills have improved on each album, and CMIYGL features some of the best production of his career (and easily his best rapping). It’s not a concept album in the sense that IGOR was, but it’s somehow just as cohesive, because Tyler tied it all together with a singular sonic theme: this is the Gangsta Grillz project he always wanted. With a little help from DJ Drama, Tyler pulls off some of the hardest-hitting records he’s ever made (“Lemonhead,” “Juggernaut,” “Lumberjack”) and puts them on the same tracklist as the most personal storytelling he’s ever put on wax (“Wilshire”). Following the comparatively melodic IGOR, some people are making the mistake of referring to CMIYGL as a top-to-bottom rap album, but that’s a shortsighted way of looking at it. Tyler pulled together all of his musical abilities on a single project, and did it at a higher level than he has in the past. Sure, he’s rapping all over this thing, but he also left room for 10 minutes of melodic extravagance (“Sweet / I Thought You Wanted to Dance”) and made NBA YoungBoy sound at home on an R&B record (“Wusyaname”). This album is full of flexes, from the lyrics to the guest features, and it’s clear Tyler knows exactly how good he is right now. The biggest flex of all, though, is that he somehow keeps getting better with age. It’s scary to think what he might have planned next. —Eric Skelton</p>
