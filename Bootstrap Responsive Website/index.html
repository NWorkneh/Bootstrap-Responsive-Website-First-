            <div class="col-md-6 bio" style="margin-top: 500px;">Tyler Gregory Okonma (born March 6, 1991), known professionally as Tyler, the Creator, is an American rapper and record producer. He is one of the founding members of the music collective Odd Future. Okonma has won two Grammy Awards, three BET Hip Hop Awards, a BRIT Award, and a MTV Video Music Award. Okonma is considered one of the most influential and greatest Hip-Hop music artists of all time. <br> Okonma self-released his debut mixtape Bastard in 2009 and rapidly gained attention among the online music press for his horrorcore-influenced sound and violent, transgressive lyrical content. His debut studio album Goblin (2011) brought him mainstream exposure, which was aided by the popularity of the single "Yonkers" and its accompanying music video. During this period, Odd Future gained rapid popularity and Okonma faced controversy over his lyrics, most notably with the song Yonkers. Beginning with his second album Wolf (2013), Okonma began moving away from his stylistic horrorcore towards a more alternative hip hop sound. His 2015 album Cherry Bomb featured a greater focus on melodic and jazz-fused sounds which has continued throughout his later discography. Okonma's later albums, Flower Boy (2017), Igor (2019) and Call Me If You Get Lost (2021), were all released to widespread critical acclaim, with the latter two debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 and each winning Best Rap Album at the 2020 and 2022 Grammy Awards, respectively. <br> As a visual artist, Okonma has created the cover art for Odd Future's releases, their clothing, and other merchandise.[6] In 2011, Okonma founded the streetwear brand Golf Wang and then began the annual music festival Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival both in 2012. Okonma also founded and operated the streaming service Golf Media between 2015 and 2018, which contained original scripted series from Tyler and a livestream of each Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival.
